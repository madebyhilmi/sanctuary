### A meaningful take on online dating

*Dating is hard.* In a world where technology is at an all time high, finding the one hasn’t become any easier. The challenge is that as awesome as dating applications, blind dates and sliding in people’s DMs is - it doesn’t make finding someone any easier.  
As great as blind dates go, there are better ways to solve this problem. In a world filled with technology, leveraging it with a purpose built application is a much better solution. Applications that currently exist focus on ‘Hookup Culture’ and superficial values. This focus in short term, casual relationships doesn’t help young adults find the one. That entire market doesn’t have an application! 
By developing an application that focuses on establish real roots and building real relationships we can help connect users who are looking for a more serious relationship. The goal is to create an easy to use, guided application that makes it quick to find someone who you get along with. Our application gives users a platform to build tangible connections, focusing on real conversations. We will use the following goals to achieve this:	
* Focus on the interaction between users
* Ease the users into high quality conversations 
* Fast paced conversations
